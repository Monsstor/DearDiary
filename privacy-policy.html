  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how our application "Dear Diary." handles user information. 
    We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Minimal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not collect, store, process, or share any personal or sensitive user data.
    The only data read and transmitted to our server is the user's <strong>current streak count</strong>.
    No other information, personal or otherwise, is ever collected or sent.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of Streak Data</h2>
  <p>
    The streak data is used solely to sync and maintain the user's ongoing streak across devices
    or to safeguard it during reinstallations. It is not used for analytics, advertising, profiling,
    or any other secondary purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Any information that you choose to share or disclose outside the App (for example, by copying
    or sending your own content to others) remains your sole responsibility. The App and its developers
    are not responsible for any data you disclose intentionally or unintentionally.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or external services that
    track or collect personal information. The only server interaction performed is the syncing 
    of your streak count.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is safe for all ages. Since no personal information is collected, no data from children
    is ever obtained, stored, or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page 
    with a new “Last Updated” date.
  </p>
